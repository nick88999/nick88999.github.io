		<p> I'm a designer/illustrator by the name of Nick Appolon and I discovered a deep passion for art at a very early age. So much that my mother had me in art courses as early as the age of 6 and I am very fortunate that I had that opportunity and that support. </p>
    
    	<p> I am currently attending the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College since I found it to be fairly relatable to my hobby of illustrating. I am in my third year at the moment which is my last year in the program and am planning on starting up my own freelance business which will be strongly based around web design and illustration. </p>
    
    	<p> I currently do a fair amount of freelance work on the side while finishing up at school to earn my degree. I can easily be reached through gmail, twitter, facebook and instagram. All the links are posted below and I am always interested in working with new clients! </p>
